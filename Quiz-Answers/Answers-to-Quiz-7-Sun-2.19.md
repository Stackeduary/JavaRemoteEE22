2. How can you create your own custom data type?
  - create a class

3. What are the two types of equality in Java? Write them out in words as well as syntactically.
  - reference equality

    - `object1.equals(object2)`

4. Continuing from the previous question, which one can the developer provide his/her own implementation of?
  - `.equals()`

5. Reference equality implies value equality.
